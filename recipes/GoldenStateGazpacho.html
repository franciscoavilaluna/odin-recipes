        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
        Many gazpacho recipes that include fruit turn out tasting more like dessert, which is fine if that's what you're into, but if you want a super-refreshing, seriously savory gazpacho, then this peach-kissed version is for you. You can't go wrong with this very simple recipe; served ice-cold, it might just be your new favorite thing to eat on a hot, sunny afternoon.
        </p>
