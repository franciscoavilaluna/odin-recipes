        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
        Above and beyond producing something that's visually impressive, we are also flavoring our pork chops from the inside out with this method. So, this is basically a technique video and will work no matter what stuffing you decide to use--although this peach stuffing was absolutely delicious.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Slices bacon, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup diced onion</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons diced poblano pepper</li>
            <li>1 Large yellow peach - peeled, pitted, and diced</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
            <li>1/4 Teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 Teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 Pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>8 Saltine crackers, crushed</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons chicken broth, or as needed (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>For the Pork Chops:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Double-cut boneless pork chops</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup chicken broth (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons cold salted butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                Cook bacon in a nonstick pan over medium heat until almost crisp, about 5 minutes. Add onion and poblano pepper and saute until onion turns translucent, 5 to 6 minutes more. Add peach and cook until tender and starting to give off some juice. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Stir thyme leaves, black pepper, salt, cayenne, and saltine crackers into the peach mixture. Add 2 tablespoons chicken broth if needed for added moisture. Refrigerate until needed.</li>
            <li>
                Cut a pocket in the center of each pork chop, starting with a small incision on the fat side of the chop, exactly halfway down. Use the tip of the knife to cut as close to the edges as possible without poking through. Try to make an incision at least 2 inches wide.
            </li>
            <li>Fill the pockets with the stuffing, packing and pressing in firmly. Season both sides of the chops with salt.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in an oven-safe pan over high heat. Sear chops in the hot oil until browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Carefully turn the chops over and transfer the pan to the center of the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers reads 145 degrees F to 150 degrees F (63 to 66 degrees C), about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove chops from the pan to a plate and cover loosely with foil.</li>
            <li>
                Return the pan to the stovetop and place a towel over the hot handle. Add 1/4 cup chicken broth and balsamic vinegar. Bring to a boil while scraping the bottom of the pan with a spoon to deglaze. Turn off heat and stir in butter. Adjust seasoning if desired and serve over pork chops.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
        <p>You can use a jalapeno, or other green pepper, instead of poblano if you like. Feel free to substitute any fresh fruit you'd like for the peach, as well as any fresh herb for the thyme.</p>
        <p>You can use crumbled bread cubes, bread crumbs, or even cornbread instead of saltine crackers if you like.</p>
        <p>Just like you can use any stuffing you want, you can use any liquid and vinegar you like in your sauce.</p>
