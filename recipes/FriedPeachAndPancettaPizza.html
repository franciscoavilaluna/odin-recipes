        Extra dough and scraps rolled out, left to rise, fried, and sprinkled

        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 Ounces pancetta bacon, thickly sliced</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>12 Ounces pizza dough, or more to taste, cut into quarters</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 Cup olive oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons chopped fresh thyme, or to taste</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>20 Slices fresh peach</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or to taste</li>
            <li>4 Teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line baking sheets with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle pancetta into a cold skillet and drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil over pancetta. Cook and stir pancetta over medium heat until browned and caramelized, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat and cool pancetta in the oil in the skillet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place 1 dough quarter on a work surface and lightly dust with flour; roll into a 1/8-inch-thick irregularly shaped crust. Stretch dough with your hands to an even thickness; let rest on the work surface for 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat about 1 cup olive oil, reaching about 1/2-inch depth, in a heavy cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Fry each piece of dough until browned and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. The first side will be lighter than the second side. Drain the crusts on paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer pizza crusts, lighter-side up, to prepared baking sheets. Spread about 2 tablespoons ricotta cheese onto each crust using the back of a spoon. Sprinkle about 1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme over ricotta layer. Sprinkle pancetta over the ricotta-thyme layer; season with black pepper. Nestle about 5 peach slices onto each pizza, working around the pancetta pieces. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon Parmesan-Reggiano cheese over each pizza. Drizzle about 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil over Parmesan-Reggiano layer.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and peaches are lightly browned and tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool pizzas for 5 to 10 minutes on the baking sheet.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
        <p>The fried pizza crusts can be made ahead of time.</p>
        <p>Fresh basil can be used in place of the thyme for a sweeter flavor.</p>
